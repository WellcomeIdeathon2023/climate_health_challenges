# Develop a dashboard for tracking the effects of methane emissions on health

## Background

Methane emissions are the biggest contributor to the formation of [ground-level ozone](https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics). Methane is also a greenhouse gas that causes global heating and is [80 times more potent than CO2](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them). Reducing methane can be driven by societal and agricultural changes (such as farming less meat) but technology also has a big role to play, for example, by utilising machine learning to [optimise infrastructure repair](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1792/) or to [quickly detect and prevent methane leaks](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/machine-learning-and-satellite-imaging-to-reduce-methane-emissions/). Despite advances and interest in the area, there has not been a lot of research linking methane and health data in an accessible way that can be used by clinicians or policymakers to adapt to and mitigate the increasing public health pressures from methane emissions.

## Challenge

Use the provided datasets to create a dashboard that can be used by policymakers and clinicians to understand and track the impact of methane on health – in particular [respiratory disease](https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/news/methane%E2%80%99s-links-respiratory-diseases-strengthens-case-its-rapid-reduction) and [mental health](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/air-pollutants-and-daily-number-of-admissions-to-psychiatric-emergency-services-evidence-for-detrimental-mental-health-effects-of-ozone/581CC5CBFC954B0A78115B025C0CE103). The platform should be user-friendly and not require expert climate knowledge but should provide enough information to enable evidence-driven mitigation strategies to improve the health of populations. For example, how might a clinician or policymaker use your platform to prepare for increases in number of patients to respiratory wards in hospitals? How might a policymaker leverage the platform to lobby companies to quickly fix leaky pipelines? In addition, your platform should be modular and interoperable so multiple data sources can be incorporated for health and methane data of distinct types, for example suitable for satellite and on-the- ground methane sites. Moreover, your platform should also allow users to upload their own data that could be overlayed onto downloaded methane data.

## Questions to answer in your presentation

1. How has your platform presented complex methane and health data (and their relationship) in a way that can be understood by key stakeholders but without ‘dumbing down’ the information?
2. How would you ensure your platform is accessible, usable,
and sustainable and that data can be shared safely and well credited?
3. How will your platform integrate datasets with different time and geographical scales?
