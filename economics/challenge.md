# Accessible development of metrics and models for assessing the economic impacts of climate change

## Background

Climate change has direct impacts on human health, for example due to global heating and extreme weather events, as well as indirect impacts by increasing the spatial distribution and incidence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases. Climate change can also influence human health by economic impacts. For example, by [inflation](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INSPIRE-Sustainable-Central-Banking-Toolbox-Policy-Briefing-1-1.pdf), [job loss](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%2520Cost%2520of%2520Free%2520Entry%2520An%2520Empirical%2520Study%2520of%2520Real%2520.pdf), and diversion of financial resources to restore infrastructure destroyed by global heating â€“ all of which have direct knock-on effects on human health. To help set and optimise targets that drive action to minimise the harmful direct effects of climate change on human health, Wellcome is funding a project to [standardise climate-health metrics](https://wellcome.org/news/standardising-health-and-climate-metrics-drive-urgent-action) that can be used for agenda setting and policymaking. Now we are looking to tackle the negative effects on human health that result from the economic impacts of climate change. We are interested in understanding how to develop standardised
metrics for measuring the economic impacts of climate change that can be utilised for policymaking and model development.

## Challenge

Use the provided datasets to demonstrate how data science approaches could be used to identify correlations and metrics that can be used for inference/ prediction of the economic impacts of climate change on health. You might consider representation learning for generating new relationships between variables, reinforcement learning for identifying objectives to optimise, unsupervised learning for clustering, supervised learning for identification
of predictors, or any other method, including non-ML methods.
As well as identifying the potential of these models, demonstrate how these
could be selected by people without coding experience on a no-code open-access platform where users can bring their own economic and climate datasets, run models and workflows on top of these, and then visualise, analyse, and download results. For any identified climate-economic metrics (which need not be verified
in practice for this event), demonstrate how these could practically be utilised in model development and optimisation and for long-term model deployment.

## Questions to answer in your presentation

1. How would your platform allow users to demonstrate that any metrics/models developed on the platform are useful in the real-world?
2. How will you ensure your results generalise to continually updated climate and economic data as well as new data sources?
3. How will your platform, in particular analysis and visualisation tools, handle uncertainty and variability in climate data?
